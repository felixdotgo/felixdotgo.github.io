It's been more than two weeks since I got fired. I'm not even sad, because I had already anticipated that day would come - sooner or later. I also acknowledge that I lacked some key skills that could have helped me perform better at work. So when my engineering manager decided to stop engaging with me, I just thought, “Okay.”

After saying a few words of thanks, I prepared my handover and was locked out of the system. Everything happened within just two hours.

Now, I’m spending time reflecting and reviewing myself - what I did right, what I did wrong - so I can grow and avoid making the same mistakes in my next job. Life pressures are chasing me from behind, but focusing on what truly matters helps me feel less afraid.

Let’s see what the future holds. I'm looking forward to the next career opportunities.
